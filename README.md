    This page is the representation of the *main google search page*, it
    requires the user to type in the search query in the search bar and the
    page passes the search query through a form to the google servers to
    process the query and show the user appropriate search results.

2. ***Images.html***

    This page is the representation of the *google image search page*, it also
    requires the user to type in the search query in the search bar and redirects
    the user to google images page with the appropriate image search results as
    queried by the user.

    4 form text inputs that takes users specific search filters and on clicking the
    advanced search button takes you to the appropriate google search page.

    elements.
